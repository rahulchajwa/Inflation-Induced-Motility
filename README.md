# Inflation-Induced-Motility
The code slingshot.m is used to numerically integrate the Odinary Differential Equation 4 in the manuscript bioRxiv 2022.08.19.504465; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.19.504465 
and to get Figure 4 e & f

The code is written in MATLAB and uses function ODE45, based on the Runge Kutta method.
